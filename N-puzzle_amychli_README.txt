NP-Puzzle chosen: 3x3 n-puzzle 
____________________________

A Python program that solves a given 3x3 n-puzzle. 

THE N-PUZZLE:
--------
The n-Puzzle, also called sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that asks the player to slide numbered pieces across a board to reach a predetermined end-configuration. They are two-dimensional puzzles. The common puzzle is a 3 x 3 sliding puzzle with a 3 x 3 matrix, with numbers of pieces ranging from 1 to 8. The last spot on the matrix is ‘empty’ or ‘-‘ or ‘blank’. It what allows the number of pieces to slide into, and thus allow the puzzle to be rearranged. 

See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle


USEAGE:
--------

Program asks user to input a start state for a 3x3 n-puzzle. For example:
1 2 3
- 4 6
7 5 8
*where '-' is the blank space

The goal state is shown to be:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 -   
*where '-' is the blank space

RETURNS:
----------

Each step of the rearranged start state puzzle to reach the goal state.
